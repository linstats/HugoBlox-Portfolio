In addition to my academic and professional endeavors, I am passionate about badminton. I was a member of the Southern University of Science and Technology's campus team, where I specialized in men's doubles alongside my partner, [Liu Chengyu](http://www.jiangxingyusustech.com/page131?article_id=64)（刘澄昱）.

During my time on the team, I had the privilege of training under two exceptional coaches:  

- [Sun Yu](https://bwfbadminton.com/player/92736/sun-yu)（孙瑜）, the former world champion and professional badminton player,  
- [Zeng Yumin](http://sport.sustech.edu.cn/show-29-4-1.html)（曾煜民）, coach from the Guangdong Provincial badminton team.

Their guidance refined my skills and strategy in men's doubles badminton. Just as important were the friendships with my teammates, especially my partner.
