For me, the beauty of statistics lies in its ability to make sense of the world, and I take great joy in sharing this with others. Whether through formal instruction or casual conversations with friends, family, and peers, I aim to promote the use of statistical methods across diverse fields.

My teaching philosophy centers around the belief that visualization is a powerful tool for understanding complex statistical and probabilistic ideas. By leveraging visual techniques, abstract concepts become more accessible and intuitive, helping students—regardless of their background—grasp the essence of statistical thinking.
