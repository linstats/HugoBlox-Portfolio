I’m Zhu Xuelin, born and raised in China. Currently, I’m pursuing a PhD in statistics, and I’m also an amateur badminton player.

My research interests lie at the intersection of functional data analysis and deep learning. I am particularly focused on exploring the universal approximation theorem as it applies to deep neural networks for modeling and analyzing functional data.

In addition to my academic and professional endeavors, I am passionate about badminton. I was a member of the Southern University of Science and Technology’s campus team, where I specialized in men’s doubles.
